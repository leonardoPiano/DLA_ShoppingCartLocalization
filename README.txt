##Problem Introduction
The location of the shopping cart, is a useful activity in order to understand the behaviors and interests
of customers within the stores. Such information can be used to improve the management of the store
and to provide personalized services to the customers. For instance, location information can be used to
infer where the customers spend more time, which areas of the store they prefer. The problem can be
addressed as an image-based location problem, developing an algorithm that given an image taken in a
known space, allows you to infer the position from which the image was taken.
##Dataset
The dataset is taken from the Machine Learning Challange (2018) of the University of Catania.
